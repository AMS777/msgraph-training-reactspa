Open your command-line interface (CLI), navigate to a directory where you have rights to create files, and run the following commands to install the [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app) tool and create a new React app.

```Shell
npm install create-react-app@2.1.0 -g
create-react-app graph-tutorial
```

Once the command finishes, change to the `graph-tutorial` directory in your CLI and run the following command to start a local web server.

```Shell
npm start
```

Your default browser opens to [https://localhost:3000/](https://localhost:3000) with a default React page. If your browser doesn't open, open it and browse to [https://localhost:3000/](https://localhost:3000) to verify that the new app works.
